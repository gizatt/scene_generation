20181127: 1000 1x1 boxes, generated randomly over
[0:1, 0:1, 0:2pi], with uniformly randomly between
0 and 10 of them.

20181207: Same, but geometric distribution with p=0.5
# of boxes, rather than uniform random.

20181214: Same, but exactly 2 of them.

20190104: 1000 1x1 boxes, generated randomly over
[0.25:0.75, 0:1, 0:2pi], with geometric distribution as
in 20181207.

20190104 normal: 1000 1x1 boxes, generated with geometric
distirbution over num objects as above, with with normal
x y theta distributions centered at [0.5, 0.5, pi]
with variance [0.125, 0.25, pi].
